### Benefits of the AWS Cloud

#### Define the AWS Cloud and its value proposition

AWS Cloud
: Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. Millions of customers—including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies—are using AWS to lower costs, become more agile, and innovate faster.

AWS Cloud Value Proposition
: **Security** -- AWS offers multiple Security and Compliance services for various applications. Apart from the Shared Responsibility Model, there are options for configuring extra security measures.
: **Agility** -- Applications can be developed and deployed globally across multiple geolocations within minutes. The speed of experimentation, development and deployment is exponentially higher compared to applications developed on-premises.
: **Flexibility** -- AWS offers multiple services for various applications. There are over 200 products that support services to run all kinds of workloads.
: **Elasticity** -- Applications can scale the resources required for smooth operability based on the demand — the application capacity is sufficient to deal with the incoming requests while paying for only what they use.
: **Cost** -- AWS makes it easy to scale up and down based on demand and removes the need for an on-premise data centre to reduce costs. By using the pay as you go model, costs incurred can be monitored and reduced.

Question walkthrough

Q: The ability to horizontally scale Amazon EC2 instances based on demaind is an example of which concept of the AWS Cloud value proposition?
A: Elasticity

#### Identify aspects of AWS Cloud economics

AWS Cloud economics
: How operating in AWS can affect your orgs ownership and operational costs

Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) concepts

1.  Operational expenses (opex)
    : day-to-day costs to your org such as services and items that get used up. examples: printer toner, website hosting, etc
2.  Capital expenses (capex)
    : costs associated with creating the longer-term benefits. purchasing a building, servers, power back-ups
3.  Labor costs associated with on premises operations
    : costs incured to handle on premecise infra
4.  Impact of software licensing laws
    : can your software licenses be moved to the cloud, or are there ones with AWS that you can use instead

Cost reduction operations:

1. Right size infrastructure
2. Automation
3. Reduce Compliance Scope
4. Managed services

Question walkthrough

Q: Which on premises expense will be reduced if the company migrates their app to amazon ec2?
A: Server hardware costs

Tip: even when the stem does not state it; always look for the most correct response.

#### Explain the cloud architecture design principles

1. Design for failure
2. Decouple components vs monotlithic architecture
3.
4.
