# What was that?

# This \ (backslash) character encodes difficult-to-type characters into a string
# An important escape sequence is to escape a single-quote (') or double-quote
# ("). Imagine you have a string that uses double-quotes and you want to put a
# double-quote inside the string. If you write "I "understand" joe." then
# Python will get confused because it will think the double-quotes around
# "understand" actually ends the string. You need a way to tell Python that
# the double-quote inside the string isnâ€™t a real double-quote.
